    "### **Why Do We Need the `input` Function?**\n",
    "The `input()` function in Python is essential for interactive applications. It allows developers to prompt users to enter data, which is vital for customizing user experiences. This feature is crucial for obtaining real-time feedback or details directly from users, making it a fundamental tool for creating dynamic and responsive programs where user input can directly influence the program's outcome.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Basics about `input` Syntax**\n",
    "The `input()` function enables a program to take input from the user, which is always returned as a string. You can optionally provide a prompt message that will be displayed to the user. Example usage:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `user_name = input(\"Enter your name: \")` — Asks the user for their name.\n",
    "- `user_age = input(\"Enter your age: \")` — Prompts the user for their age.\n",
    "- `user_age = input()` — Waits for input without any prompt.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Using `input` to Capture User Input**\n",
    "Effectively capturing user input is crucial in programs that require user interaction. The `input()` function can gather the necessary data to make decisions, perform calculations, or manage user preferences. Examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Example 1\n",
    "user_input = input()\n",
    "\n",
    "# Example 2\n",
    "user_response = input(\"Do you want to continue? Yes/No: \")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Example 3\n",
    "user_number = int(input(\"Enter a number to double: \"))\n",
    "print(f\"The doubled number is {user_number * 2}\")\n",
    "```\n",

    "### **Question: Build a Mini Chatbot**\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise, you will write **two `input()` statements** to capture the user's name and age. The rest of the chatbot code is already written for you.\n",
    "\n",
    "The chatbot should:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Display a greeting: `\"Hello! I am Chatty the chatbot.\"`\n",
    "2. Ask the user for their name. **This is where your code goes.**\n",
    "3. Repeat the user's name back in a friendly message.\n",
    "4. Ask the user for their age. **This is where your code goes.**\n",
    "5. Print the user's age in dog years.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Instructions:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Replace the first `TODO` comment with an `input()` statement to ask the user for their name.\n",
    "* Store the response in a variable called `user_name`.\n",
    "* Replace the second `TODO` comment with an `input()` statement to ask the user for their age.\n",
    "* Notice that the user's age is surrounded by an `int()` function before using it to calculate the age in dog years. We will explore this Python functionality more in the rest of the demo.\n",
