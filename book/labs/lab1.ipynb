    "### Task\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise, you will build a program called **BioBot** that generates a personalized social media bio based on three pieces of user input. Each input will be provided by the user on separate lines. \n",
    "\n",
    "You will write your code in `exercise1.py`, on the left.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Instructions**\n",
    "1. Greet the user with a welcome message:  \n",
    "   ```plaintext\n",
    "   Welcome to the BioBot!\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Ask the user for the following information:  \n",
    "   - **Job**: Prompt the user with:\n",
    "     ```plaintext\n",
    "     What is your job?\n",
    "     ``` \n",
    "   - **Hobby**: Prompt the user with:\n",
    "     ```plaintext\n",
    "     What is your hobby?\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "   - **Life Motto**: Prompt the user with:\n",
    "     ```plaintext\n",
    "     What is your motto?\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. After gathering the inputs, display the personalized bio in the following format:  \n",
    "   ```plaintext\n",
    "   Here is your personalized social media bio:\n",
    "\n",
    "   I am a [job]\n",
    "   My main hobby is [hobby]\n",
    "   \"[motto]\"\n",

    "# Quick note about escape sequences!\n",

    "As you can see `motto` needs to be wrapped in quotes. The issue is you may already be using double quotes for your string making it look like this: `my_string_var = \"\"My code in quotes\"\"`\n",

    "This will cause an error. We avoid this by using escape sequences like this: `my_string_var = \"\\\"My code in quotes\\\"\"`\n",

    "## Exercise 2: Shopping Cart Calculator\n",

    "### Task\n",
    "Create a program that calculates the final total for a shopping cart based on three user inputs. The inputs will be provided one per line:  \n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Subtotal**: The total cost of the items before any discounts or taxes. When you prompt the user for this input, it will be entered as a float. \n",
    "2. **Percent Discount**: The percentage discount to apply to the subtotal. When you prompt the user for this input, it will be entered as a float (e.g., 20 for 20%).  \n",
    "3. **Tax Percentage**: The percentage tax to apply after the discount. When you prompt the user for this input, it will be entered as a float (e.g., 7.5 for 7.5%).  \n",
    "\n",
    "The program should perform the following calculations in order:  \n",
    "1. **Apply the discount first**:  \n",
    "   - Convert the discount percentage to a fraction by dividing it by 100.  \n",
    "   - Multiply the fraction by the subtotal to find the discount amount.  \n",
    "   - Subtract the discount amount from the subtotal to get the discounted price.  \n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Apply the tax next**:  \n",
    "   - Convert the tax percentage to a fraction by dividing it by 100.  \n",
    "   - Multiply the tax fraction by the discounted price to find the tax amount.  \n",
